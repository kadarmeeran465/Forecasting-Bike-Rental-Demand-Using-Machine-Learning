## Approach 🚀

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Utilized `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets containing weather-related features and bike rental counts.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created additional features like time-based attributes (hour, day of the week, month) and interactions with weather conditions.
  
   - ## Exploratory Data Analysis 📊

    Below are key insights gained from the data, showing distributions and relationships between bike rentals, weather conditions, and other factors:

    - **Rental Distribution**: Shows how bike rental counts vary by hour, day, and weather conditions.
    - **Weather vs. Rental Demand**: Illustrates how weather patterns affect demand, indicating that clear days have higher rentals.
    - **Feature Correlations**: Highlights the correlations between bike rental counts and other features like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
