## Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting hourly bike rental demand by leveraging historical usage patterns and weather data through machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency, optimize inventory management, improve revenue strategies, and provide insights for urban planning.

## Skills and Techniques

- **Regression**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Urban Mobility**
- **Transportation Analytics**
- **Time Series Forecasting**

## Problem Statement

The objective is to predict the hourly demand for bike rentals by analyzing historical data and weather conditions. Accurate forecasts will help in efficient bike distribution, optimized maintenance, improved pricing strategies, and better urban infrastructure planning.

## Business Use Cases

- **Operational Efficiency**: Enhance bike allocation and distribution across stations to meet demand effectively.
- **Inventory Management**: Optimize maintenance schedules and reduce downtime by predicting demand.
- **Revenue Optimization**: Adjust pricing strategies based on demand forecasts to maximize revenue.
- **Urban Planning**: Offer insights for better infrastructure and bike-sharing station placements.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Use `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets with weather-related features and bike rental counts.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Generate additional features such as time-based attributes (hour, day of the week, month) and interactions with weather conditions.
4. **Model Building**: Train various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) and cross-validation to ensure robustness.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance with techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
7. **Prediction**: Predict bike rental counts for the next 6 months using the best-performing model.
8. **Submission**: Save predictions in the required format and validate RMSLE using `solution_checker.xlsx`.

## Results

- The final model achieved an RMSLE of XX on the validation dataset.
- It effectively captured hourly rental patterns and weather influences, providing accurate demand forecasts.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)**: The primary metric for assessing the model's performance, focusing on the relative error between predicted and actual rental counts.
